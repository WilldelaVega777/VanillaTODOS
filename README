Hi again friends at Pirple.com,

A step in the right direction for componentization I believe. I hope the next homeworks 
still be related to this project and its improvement. 

Things left that I would like to add:

+ Checking all functions and event handlers for dashboard into their respective views.
  (Right now all event handlers for dashboard are centralized in lists.js).

+ Break the app down into more components (React like), add support for properties.
+ Add an event cycle and an observable interface or pattern. I have no idea yet how to do
  that, but it would be awesome to implement. 

I will soon add this project to my github (WilldelaVega777), and will keep trying to improve it.

I hope this homework was well and I can pass to the next unit. I look forward to get into
Project 2!


kind regards,
